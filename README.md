# AniMate

## About the Application

AniMate is a resource for anime tier lists. It allows the user to view tier lists for anime series and anime movies, as well as offering some basic information for each. The user can also click on the "Add to Watch Later" button to add that anime to a list on the user profile page. The watch later list also has an "Add New Anime' feature where the user can input information for a new anime and add it to the list, which then the user can edit or delete any anime off the list.

## Future Additions

In the future I think it would be cool to add:

- search for anime (by sepecific title)
- search for/browse anime by categories
- OAuth for additional users
- descriptions for each anime
- cleaner CSS
